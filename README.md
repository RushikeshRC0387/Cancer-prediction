This project uses logistic regression to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) based on cell nucleus features. It preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Demonstrates logistic regression's effectiveness in medical diagnosis.
